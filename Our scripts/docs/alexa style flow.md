how can we make the code like... alllow access for like... 'computer, launch a new window in chatgpt and ask it whats abstract algebra'. like, im assuming we need an llm call that will turn that command into a few things: 1. 'launch voice browser', 2. 'go to better gpt', 3. 'locate chat bar', 4. 'type 'whats abstract algebra'', 5. 'hit enter'
